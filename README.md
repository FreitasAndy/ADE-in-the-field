# ADE-in-the-field

## Overview

This repository hosts scripts and data from a study exploring how Amazonian Dark Earth (ADE) influences soil microbiomes and early growth of native tropical trees. ADE is a fertile, human-made soil rich in organic matter and microbial life, offering unique potential for restoring degraded ecosystems.

## Key Findings

Small ADE additions improved the growth of Schizolobium amazonicum and Handroanthus avellanedae.

ADE reshaped soil microbial communities, reducing pathogens and enriching beneficial taxa.

Shifts in microbial networks and functions suggest enhanced soil resilience and suppressive capacity.

Results highlight the microbiome as the core driver of ADEâ€™s restorative power.
